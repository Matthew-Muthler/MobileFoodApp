# MobileFoodApp
Android Studio App designed for Lock Haven University. The program displays images of the food and a description. The user has the ability to add/un-add items to their cart and checkout.

- How to create a well-formatted front-end design for user experience
- How to construct back-end code that smoothly worked with the front-end design
- Learned how to use buttons to call different activities
- Learned how to display different text according to what time of day it was
- Learned how to reset the program after a user completed their order
